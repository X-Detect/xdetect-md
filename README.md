# X Detect

X Detect is a mobile application developed for detecting and predicting certain elements using machine learning models. The app integrates with various APIs, including authentication APIs provided by Cloud Computing and prediction APIs that utilize machine learning models. This README provides an overview of the project's flow, technologies used, and how to set up and run the application.

## Technologies Used

- Mobile Development: The application is developed using [insert mobile development framework/platform here, e.g., Android Studio].
- XML Layout: The user interface of the application is created using XML layout files.
- Retrofit: To make HTTP requests to the authentication APIs and retrieve data from various endpoints, Retrofit is utilized as the networking library.
- Cloud Computing: The authentication APIs provided by Cloud Computing are used for user login, registration, and other related functionalities.
- Firebase: The application runs in real-time using Firebase, which enables seamless integration with the internet and allows for dynamic updates.

## Flow of the Project

1. User Interface: An attractive and user-friendly interface is created using XML layout files. The interface is designed to provide a smooth and intuitive experience for users.
2. User Authentication: The application integrates with Cloud Computing's authentication APIs. Users can register and log in to the application securely using their credentials.
3. Article Retrieval: The application sends requests to APIs that provide articles or content required within the application. These APIs are utilized to retrieve the necessary information for display purposes.
4. Prediction Functionality: Predictions are made by sending requests to APIs that utilize machine learning models provided by the Machine Learning team. These models are designed to detect and predict specific elements.
5. Real-time Functionality: The application utilizes Firebase to run in real-time. This allows for seamless integration with the internet and provides dynamic updates as new data becomes available.
   
## Library 
- Retrofit: A networking library for making HTTP requests and handling API communication.
- OkHttp: A dependency of Retrofit that provides efficient HTTP client functionality.
- Gson: A library for converting JSON responses from APIs into Java objects.
- Firebase SDK: To integrate the application with Firebase for real-time functionality and other services like authentication and database.
- CameraX: A library for camera functionality, allowing you to capture images and interact with the device's camera.
- Hdodenhof's CircleImageView: A library for displaying circular images in your application's UI.
